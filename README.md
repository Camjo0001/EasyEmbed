# EasyEmbed
A discord.py bot that can help you create easy embedded messages and send them directly to a webhook without the struggle of doing any coding or work in the console!

This bot is extrmely simple to use and can be set up in minutes. You will need the "discord.py" library (not the rewrite version) and you will also need the "dhooks" library becasue discord.py 0.16.8 does not support webhooks and this library allows the use of them. 

Once you have these installed run the file after settiing up a bot user and add the token in where your token goes. Then it is simple from there the only current command is the !embed command and that brings you through a full easy to setup walkthrough on how to set up the embed. 

at the end of the code where you have to type yes or no to validate that you are satisfied with the embed you might have to type yes or no twice to actually continue with the commands, this will be fixed soon. 

Then it will ask you for you discord webhook url, to setup and find you channels webhook url you can simply follow this video, note this video is not mine it is just a really good and easy tutorial and how to create and setup a discord webhook.

This video is actually made for setting up a webhook for inputting into a sneaker bot, but instead of pasting the webhook url into a sneaker bot just paste the webhook url after the EasyEmbed bot asks you to in you discord server. 

This bot can send to any webhook as long as you have the url so you dont need to actually have the bot in the server you just need the webhook URL.
