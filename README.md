# EasyEmbed
A discord.py bot that can help you create easy embedded messages and send them directly to a webhook without the struggle of doing any coding or work in the console!

This bot is extrmely simple to use and can be set up in minutes. You will need the "discord.py" library (not the rewrite version) and you will also need the "dhooks" library becasue discord.py 0.16.8 does not support webhooks and this library allows the use of them. 

Once you have these installed run the file after settiing up a bot user and add the token in where your token goes
